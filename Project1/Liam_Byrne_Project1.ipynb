    "This Project will look at the important interactions within a small accounting firm in 1993. The social and work interactions were tracked by the employees and the researchers. We will be looking at the important people within these circles by measuring the individualâ€™s degree of centrality and eigenvector centrality within these networks. We will look at these centrality measurements using the attributes of gender and job role.\n",

    "\n",
    "As far as work interactions, it appears that job titles (i.e.*partners* and *managers*) play a significant role in importance within the network at this accounting firm. From the centrality analysis, it appears that the *partners* have a lot of interaction within their groups and that work details flow through these induvial to other parts of the company. This does not seem out of the ordinary of how most companies work.\n",

    "The social networks within a company can sometimes be very instrumental in getting things accomplished and spreading information that is not possible within the typical work hierarchical structure. These induvial who have a large degree of social interaction and who can bridge large social groups can either be a service or a liability depending on the type of information and ideas they circulate.\n"
