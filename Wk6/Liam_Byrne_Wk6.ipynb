    "## Introduction\n",
    "A simple two-node network, which contains the attendance of 18 Southern Women at 14 social events, is used in this network analysis. In order to analyze this network, it needs to be transformed into a one-mode network either containing the network relationships between the women who attended the same function or the network relationships between events attended by the same women. We will accomplish this by describing this two-mode network as a bipartite graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are asked, what we can infer about the relationships between **(1)** the women, and **(2)** the social events? This will be done by looking at the degree centrality and eigenvector centrality of the respective one-mode networks."

    "Looking at the minimum social distance between the women can explain how close they could be to individuals within the network. This is done by taking the inverse of the sum of shortest paths from a woman *u* to all other women *v* and multiplying by the sum of minimum of possible distances *n-1*. This centrality can measure the closeness to individuals relative to those in the network. Meaning, whoever has the largest closeness centrality would be most able to serve as the shortest conduit between any two non-directly connected women in a connected network. We will use the inverse of the weight, which will give a shorter path to the individual with the more connections.\n",
