    "This Project will look at a two-mode network of personal donations to committees during the 2016 year. These committees are mainly political and include organizations such as political action committees (PACs), political interest groups and campaigns. The donors include individuals, companies and other varied groups. The data gathered from the [Federal Election Commission](http://classic.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml) contains a wealth of information about donors, committees and elections. It would be interesting to use network analysis using some of this information, but in order to stay on track under the project metrics, we will solely be looking at the a subset of individuals donating to committees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose behind this analysis is to isolate circles of big political movers and shakers and similar individuals who move in these circles. It is not surprising to see individuals such as George Soros and the Adelson Family running in these elite circles, but it is interesting to see names and organizations not familiar to the American mainstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two networks will be analyzed:\n",
    "+ A network of individuals who share donations to the same committee\n",
    "+ A network of committees who share donors\n",
