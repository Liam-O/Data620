This data was originally made public, and posted to the web, by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation. Nodes of the network are email addresses and if an address i sent at least one email to address j, the graph contains an undirected edge from i to j. Note that non-Enron email addresses act as sinks and sources in the network as we only observe their communication with the Enron email addresses.\n",
